# single-cycle-riscv
Design and implementation of a Single-Cycle RISC-V processor in verilog, supporting the RV32I ISA

This Design supports all the instructions of the [RV32I](https://msyksphinz-self.github.io/riscv-isadoc/html/rvi.html) ISA.

## Usage
Start a project in any Hardware Design suite (Vivado or Quartus Prime). 
Clone this repository and build the design using the verilog designs.

## Contributing
Please feel free to open a PR for contributing or for any issues.
This design can further be improved to accomodate the RV32M, RV32A ISA.
